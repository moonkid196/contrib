# CFEngine Contrib

*Contributed promises. (Practical examples of using Cfengine 3 to automate
system administration). NOT FROM CFENGINE.ORG/CFENGINE.COM -- contributed by
Cfengine users.*

This is a fork of the original cfengine/contrib repository. It was seeing
little activity, so I decided to have a go at contributing my own work and make
this more robust. Hopefully, this might generate some interest in such a thing
again.

The text from the origin is below. Enjoy!
